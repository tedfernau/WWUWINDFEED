# WWU WIND FEED

WWU Wind Feed was my 2017 senior project in electrical engineering. WWU Wind Feed is a microcontroller device that serves a web page with the current wind speed at Western Washington University's Lakewood Boathouse in Bellingham WA, USA.

The project was to develop an embedded system from concept to prototype, designing and building custom hardware and firmware.

It was a great first dive into product design, mixed signal electronics design, PCB design, PCB assembly and debugging and rework, firmware development in C, and project management. The experience revealed deficits in my skills, knowledge, and personality. These revelations have been useful.


There is a video demonstration of the system here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgjqADhZPg

## Conceptual Design

What is the concept, anything interesting?


## Hardware

What is the hardware design like?

## Firmware

what is the firmware design like?

## Conclusion

Here is the current status of the project, how would I proceed witht his project?
